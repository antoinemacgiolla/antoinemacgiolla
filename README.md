- 👋 Hi, I’m @antoinemacgiolla, which is sort of my real name
- 👀 I’m interested in Python programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pygame, followed by blender
- 💞️ I’m not looking to colaborate as I am a lone wolf
- 📫 I don't wish to be contacted, although I may change my mind later
- 😄 Pronouns: what does this mean?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't have a sense of humour, so sorry but no fun facts
